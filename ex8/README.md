##Study Drills
1. Checks done and no mistakes this time.

2. It seems to primarily use single quotes as this is also seen in the ouput from line 4, but in the third string of output for line 7(or 10 more closely) we see double quotes as there is an apostrophe in "didn't" and this could cause a syntax error.
