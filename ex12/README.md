##Study Drills
1. Ok I read it, similar to what i learned in study drill 1 for exercise 11.

2. This shouldn't count as a drill.

3. As i expected pydoc is a documentation generator and online help system.

4. Very interesting, the first two clearly have to do with file reading/writing and the last two seem to have something to do with importing and making a program usable across different systems.
