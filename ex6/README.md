##Study Drills
1. See ex6-1.py

2. Lines 4, 9, 10, 13

3. This is questionable because it depends on if you count line 13 because it is a special case. If you count this and the fact that line 4 has two lines being inserted that would be more than four.

4. Adding two strings like w and e with + makes a longer string because the + character concatenates two strings.
