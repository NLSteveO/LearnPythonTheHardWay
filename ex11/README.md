##Study Drills
1. Python's raw_input function reads a line from input, converts it to a string, and returns that.

2. One other way you can use this is by specifing a prompt in the brackets like so "raw_input('---> ')". Also see ex11-2.py to seethis example used.

3. See ex11-3.py

4. The last line has '6\'2"' because the ' after the 6 is between two ' and would end the string early so python inserts a \ automatically to escape the '.
